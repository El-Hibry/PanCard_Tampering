# PanCard_Tampering
The primary aim of this project is to detect tampering of a PAN card using computer vision. This project is designed to help organizations determine whether an ID (specifically a PAN card) provided by an employee or customer is original or not.


**🎯 Project Aim**

The primary aim of this project is to detect tampering of a PAN card using computer vision.
This project is designed to help organizations determine whether an ID (specifically a PAN card)
provided by an employee or customer is original or not.



**📋 Project Objectives**

To achieve this aim, the project outlines the following objectives:

1.  Load Images:
    - Open both the original (template) PAN card image and the user-provided (tampered) image.

2.  Pre-process Images:
    - Resize both images to a uniform size (250x160 pixels) for comparison.
    - Convert the resized images to grayscale. This is done because grayscale images (1 channel) are less complex for machines to process than colored images (3 channels).

3.  Calculate Similarity:
    - Compute the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) between the two grayscale images. This provides a score (e.g., ~31.2% in the notebook) to quantify the similarity. A lower score indicates less similarity.

4.  Identify Differences:
    - Use the 'diff' (difference) image generated by the SSIM comparison.
    - Apply a threshold to this 'diff' image to convert it into a binary (black and white) image, which isolates the areas of difference.
    - Find the contours (outlines) of these different areas from the thresholded image.

5.  Visualize Tampering:
    - Draw bounding rectangles (boxes) around the detected contours on both the original and tampered images. This visually highlights the specific locations where the images do not match.

6.  Analyze Results:
    - Use the low SSIM score to conclude that the user-provided image is fake or tampered.
